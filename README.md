# Cammegh Website Read Me

This is my rebuild of the cammegh.com website using HTML and CSS, with select parts of Bootstrap used for styling purposes. I felt the existing webpages needed a redesign as they were very unfriendly to users, especially those on mobile devices, much of the information was outdated and quite a few sections of JavaScript did nothing except increase loading times.

My aim is to bring the website forward since the last time it was updated a decade ago, and give it a fresh new look, with user friendly links, sizing and content. I believe I can manage this through rigorous testing and a simple design that still contains all the necessary information a user, whether commercial or individual, would need.

## UX

The majority of users of the Cammegh site, using their existing customer base as a template, are part of bigger businesses. Therefore the UX design process needs to focus heavily on showcasing their products, and their USP of customisability.
